  summary: "Hi, my name is Misha! Thank-you for checking out my personal page. If I were to do a brief introduction of who I am, I'd probably talk about my hobbies which include mountain biking, skiing, coding and a bit of videogames on the side. This year I competed in a mountain bike race series in whistler known as 'Phat Wednesdays', with my personal record being 17th out of 65 riders in the adult male category. I'm currently a fourth-year honors student pursuing a combined degree in Computer Science and Physics, and am actively seeking a full time position, remote or in person which  would let me apply my theoretical knowledge with practical experience in order to develop the beginning of my career. I have a deep seeded passion for writing high speed, scalable algorithms which I showcase in my work and personal projects. In addition, my interests extend to physics simulation, meshing  and UI design, as reflected in my creation of a game engine, chess engine and mobile applications. "
